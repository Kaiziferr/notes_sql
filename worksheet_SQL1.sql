-- 1. Goal: Here we use users table to pull a list of user email addresses. Edit the query to pull email addresses, but only for non-deleted users.

SELECT id, email_address FROM dsv1069.users WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL

-- 2. Goal: Use the items table to count the number of items for sale in each category

SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS item_count FROM dsv1069.items GROUP BY category

-- 3. Goal: Select all of the columns from the result when you JOIN the users table to the orders table 

SELECT * FROM dsv1069.users u INNER JOIN dsv1069.orders o ON u.id = o.user_id

-- 4. Goal: Check out the query below. This is not the right way to count the number of viewed_item events. Determine what is wrong and correct the error.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) FROM dsv1069.events WHERE event_name = 'view_item' 

-- 5. Goal:Compute the number of items in the items table which have been ordered. The query
below runs, but it isnâ€™t right. Determine what is wrong and correct the error or start from scratch.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orders.item_id) FROM dsv1069.orders
