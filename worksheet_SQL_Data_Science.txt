Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =    10000  	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM attribute
ii. Business table =    10000 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM business
iii. Category table =   10000 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM category
iv. Checkin table =     10000	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM checkin
v. elite_years table =  10000	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM elite_years
vi. friend table =      10000	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM friend
vii. hours table =      10000	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM hours
viii. photo table =     10000 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM photo
ix. review table =      10000	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM review
x. tip table =          10000 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM tip
xi. user table =        10000	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM user
	
---------------------------------- SQL ----------------------------------

i. 		SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM attribute
ii. 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM business
iii.	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM category
iv. 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM checkin
v.  	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM elite_years
vi. 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM friend
vii.	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM hours
viii. 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM photo
ix.		SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM review
x. 		SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM tip
xi. 	SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'total' FROM user



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 	id: 10000				 		
ii. Hours =		business_id: 1562 		
iii. Category =	business_Id: 2643 		
iv. Attribute =	business_Id: 1115 		
v. Review =		id 		   :10000 | business_id: 8090 | user_id: 9581		
vi. Checkin = 	business_id: 493 		
vii Photo	=	id		   : 10000 | business_id : 6493 
viii. Tip =	 	user_id    : 537  |  business_id: 3979
ix. User = 		id 		   : 10000		
x. Friend = 	user_id	   : 11 		
xi. Elite_years = user_id  : 2780 		

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

---------------------------------- SQL ----------------------------------
i. 		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS 'id' FROM user 		
ii.		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(business_id)) AS 'business_id' FROM hours
iii. 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(business_Id)) AS 'business_id' FROM category
iv. 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(business_Id)) AS 'business_id' FROM attribute
v. 		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS 'primary key', COUNT(DISTINCT(business_Id)) AS 'foreign key business', COUNT(DISTINCT(user_Id)) AS 'foreign key users' FROM review 
vi. 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(business_id)) AS 'business_id' FROM checkin
vii.	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS 'id', COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS 'business_id' FROM Photo
viii. 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS 'user_id', COUNT(DISTINCT(business_id)) AS 'business_id' FROM Tip
ix. 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS 'id' FROM User
x. 		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS 'user_id' FROM Friend
xi. 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS 'user_id' FROM Elite_years

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
